An online [Misfortune Cookie](http://mis.fortunecook.ie) scanner.

If your router is vulnerable to the Misfortune Cookie bug,
you should update its firmware or replace your router.

Some routers may allow you to set custom firewall rules.
You might want to read the manual and see if that's possible.
If it is,
try dropping incoming packets on TCP port 7547,
then re-run the scanner.
The good thing about this approach is that those rules are persisted across router reboots.

My router doesn't have a firewall interface on its web panel,
so I couldn't do that.

If you're desperately worried and
(like me)
you happen to have administrative SSH access to your router,
though,
you can try adding the following iptables rule to it:

	$ iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 7547 -j DROP

If that works,
you might want to block remote access to its port 80 too,
since RomPager might also be listening on that port
(change -i ppp0 to the right interface if ppp0 is not your WAN interface;
do not remove the interface parameter,
otherwise you won't be able to connect to your router's web admin panel even from within your LAN):

	$ iptables -A INPUT -i ppp0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j DROP

Don't forget to re-run the scanner to make sure the problem has been
(temporarily)
taken care of.

Now go do something about that router...
And don't forget those settings will be lost every time it reboots.
